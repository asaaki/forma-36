## Title Bar

The title bar provides navigational guidance and primary actions on the current view.

<img src={skeleton} width="100%" />

### Content and interaction guidelines

- The Title Bar should only provide actions which are global to the current view (e.g. Button to create a user on a users list view)
- When multiple global actions are needed a dropdown menu should be used
- Buttons that submit a form on the current view should not be placed in the title bar but be part of that specific form.
